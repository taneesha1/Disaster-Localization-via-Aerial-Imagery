# Disaster Localization via Aerial Imagery

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying aerial images from the AIDER dataset into emergency-related categories. The model was trained from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras and achieved competitive results without using any pretrained architecture.

## Dataset: AIDER

- **Dataset Size:** 6,433 labeled images
- **Classes:** 5 categories
- **Train/Validation Split:**
  - **Training:** 5,469 images
  - **Validation:** 964 images
- **Source:** AIDER Dataset â€” [Original Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050881)

## Model Architecture: Custom CNN

A custom-designed CNN built from scratch. No transfer learning or pretrained backbones were used.

### Key Features:
- Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- Flatten + Dense layers for classification

| Final Validation Accuracy  | 85.89% (Epoch 30)               |
| Best Validation Loss       | 0.3802 (Epoch 27)               |
| Final Validation Loss      | 0.4247 (Epoch 30)               |
| Best Epoch                 | 27 (val_loss & val_accuracy)    |

**Weighted F1 Score:** 0.8744  
**Macro F1 Score:** 0.7954


> The model showed consistent improvement and did not suffer from overfitting. Validation performance closely tracked training accuracy.
