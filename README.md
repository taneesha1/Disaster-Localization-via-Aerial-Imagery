# Disaster Localization via Aerial Imagery

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying aerial images from the AIDER dataset into emergency-related categories. The model was trained from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras and achieved competitive results without using any pretrained architecture.

## Dataset: AIDER

- **Dataset Size:** 6,433 labeled images
- **Classes:** 5 categories
- **Train/Validation Split:**
  - **Training:** 5,469 images
  - **Validation:** 964 images
- **Source:** AIDER Dataset â€” [Original Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050881)

## Model Architecture: Custom CNN

A custom-designed CNN built from scratch. No transfer learning or pretrained backbones were used.

### Key Features:
- Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- Flatten + Dense layers for classification

## Training Summary

- **Epochs:** 30
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Normalization:** Rescaling pixel values to [0, 1]
- **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- **EarlyStopping:** Enabled (patience = 5)
- **Validation Monitoring:** `val_accuracy`

### Performance

| Metric                  | Value           |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Best Training Accuracy  | 88.32%          |
| Best Validation Accuracy| 88.17%          |
| Final Validation Accuracy | 88.17%       |
| Best Validation Loss    | 0.3671          |
| Final Validation Loss   | 0.3864          |
| Best Epoch              | 29(val_loss) / 30 (val_accuracy)       |



> The model showed consistent improvement and did not suffer from overfitting. Validation performance closely tracked training accuracy.
